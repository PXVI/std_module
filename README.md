# std_module
------------------------
A simplified one stop library for all the basic Verilog modules.


### Contents ( List of modules )
- Basic Gates
  - AND
  - OR
  - NOT
  - NOR
  - NAND
  - XOR
  - XNOR


#### Note :
All the modules here are designed in structural format of the RTL code. It is very unlikely that you will find any behavioural code in here. If there are any, I will update the list here so that it is easier to keep track of.
